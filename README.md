## Description
A theoretically cryptographic secure password generator that makes it practically impossible to forget passwords.
Additionally, despite using hashing functions it is also theoretically practically immune to rainbow tables

## How It Works

It mixes the "input" which could be the name of the website,app, etc with the master password and then hashes it. After the hash gets hashed again. ( The Hashing Function is SHA256 )
